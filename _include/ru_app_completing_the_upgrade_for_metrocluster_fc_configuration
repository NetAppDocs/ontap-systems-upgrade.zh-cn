For a MetroCluster FC configuration, you must replace the disaster recovery/failover site nodes as soon as possible. Mismatch in controller models within a MetroCluster configuration is not supported because controller model mismatch causes disaster recovery mirroring to go offline. Use the command `-skip- metrocluster-check true` option to bypass MetroCluster checks when you are replacing nodes at a second site.
